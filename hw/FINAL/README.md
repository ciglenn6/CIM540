Dog Named Sushi
Explanation:
Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
Sushi is an Instagram Pet Influencer and as a bigger portfolio piece I am branding him.
Within this brand I am making sushi pins, patches, text stickers, and more. I wanted to add
an animation to bring his brand to life.

There are four animations. One of sushi sticking his tongue out, one shaking his butt, one winking, and one giving a high five.
Some of the animations will interact with mouse press and following the mouse as well. This will be using the P5.JS library, P5.Play.

The target audience are Sushi fans from Instagram. This project will be displayed on my sushi page on my portfolio as well as on his social media.
